# Critique's Sentiment

A sentiment analysis web app that predicts the sentiment of user-provided text reviews. This project is built using **Streamlit** and incorporates text preprocessing, vectorization, and machine learning models to classify reviews as positive or negative.

## Features
- **Real-time Sentiment Prediction**: Users can input reviews and instantly get a prediction of whether the sentiment is positive or negative.
- **Comprehensive Text Preprocessing**: Includes steps like lowercasing, stop word removal, lemmatization, and sentiment-aware tokenization.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained sentiment analysis model for classification.
- **Vectorization**: Text data is transformed using TF-IDF vectorization to feed into the model.

1. **Clone the repository**:
